# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection System

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using supervised machine learning. The system handles extreme class imbalance, prioritizes precision and recall trade-offs, and integrates real-world deployment components such as dashboards and explainability.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a robust machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions.
- Handle class imbalance using SMOTE and advanced resampling methods.
- Evaluate performance with real-world metrics like ROC-AUC, F1, and business cost.
- Make the model explainable using SHAP/LIME.
- Simulate real-time fraud detection via Streamlit or Flask API.
- Explore user behavioral patterns and transaction velocity anomalies.
- Make the project deployment-ready and production-conscious.

## 🚀 Features To Be Implemented

### ✅ 1. Real-Time Fraud Detection (Streamlit or Flask)
- Simulate live transaction feed
- Predict and flag fraud in real-time
- Show prediction confidence level

### ✅ 2. Model Explainability (SHAP or LIME)
- Plot feature importance per prediction
- Explain why the model flagged fraud

### ✅ 3. Business Impact Layer
- Cost of False Positives vs False Negatives
- Expected savings based on model performance

### ✅ 4. Ensemble Model
- Combine models using VotingClassifier / Stacking
- Compare with base models

### ✅ 5. Behavioral Profiling
